# Multilayer Neural Network
Implementing a basic Multilayer Neural Network (MNN) to train and test on the MNIST data.

Task 1:
Implement a single hidden layer neural network and test the network on the XOR problem.

Task 2:
Download the MNIST Dataset and implement K-Fold to split and randomize the data.

Task 3:
Test the split MNIST data on the neural network
